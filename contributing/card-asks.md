# Contributing: card asks

Mode file of the `contributing` skill. The core
([SKILL.md](SKILL.md): Hard stops, privacy allowlist,
approval gate, file table) always applies.

## Card asks

A message "Please fix what the contribute card in this chat flagged:" followed
by lines `` `contribute · <record-id> · <code>` `` comes from **Fix in chat**
on this chat's Contribute card: the owner pressed it, and each line names a
record the card holds back and why. Möbius wrote the whole message; the card
supplied only the ids and codes. Pressing it again for an unchanged record
does not post it twice; once you restage, the card can ask again. It asks you to repair that record privately.
It is never approval to send, push or publish ([SKILL.md](SKILL.md) Hard stop
#1).
Work on exactly the named record, following `superseded_by` to its current
version, in its review worktree ([branch.md](branch.md)), then restage and
review it as [ledger.md](ledger.md) describes:

| Code | What to do |
|---|---|
| `commit_identity_mismatch` | Recommit the reviewed change with the connected account (`mapi /api/github/status` `login`) as author and committer, keeping the co-author trailer; restage and review again. |
| `invalid_pr_text` | Correct the title or body so GitHub can publish it exactly as written (length, characters, screenshot references); restage and review again. |
| `publication_destination_unavailable` | Read the record's review status again; if GitHub still cannot say where it would publish, tell the owner what is unavailable. |
| `needs_review` | Review the current head completely and record the verdict. |
| `changes_needed` | Fix what the review found; restage and review again. |
| `upstream_conflict` | Update onto the fresh upstream base and resolve the conflict, run the focused tests, restage and review again. |
| `upstream_base_moved` | Update onto the fresh upstream base and restage; review again unless the verdict carried over. |
| `source_changed` | Restage from the current reviewed source; review again if the diff changed. |
| `send_failed` | Read `last_submit_error` and `last_submit_error_code`, repair the cause ([publish.md](publish.md) failure table), restage and review again. |
| `needs_attention` | Read what the record's attention reports and resolve it. |
| `not_in_contribute` | Find what removed or replaced the record; stage the work again from this chat if it still exists, otherwise tell the owner it is gone. |
| `couldnt_check` | Read the record; if it is intact, only print a new card, otherwise repair it with the ledger's CAS rules. |
| `restage` | Restage it so its diff stat and identity are complete, then review again. |
| `stack_incomplete` | Layers of its stack are missing from the card or the ledger: prepare, review and stage only the missing private layers from this chat, so the card can list the whole stack. |
| `stack_parent_merged` | A parent layer has merged: rebuild only the remaining prepared (private) layers on the repository's fresh default branch, restage and review them again ([maintainer.md](maintainer.md) "Repair a prepared stack layer"). Never retarget the old child silently. |
| `stack_parent_changed` | A prepared layer of the named record's stack no longer sits on its parent's reviewed head (the parent was restaged or updated): rebuild only the prepared (private) layers above that parent on its current head, restage and review them again. |
| `result_unknown` | Read only: look on GitHub for the exact branch and pull request. Record a PR you find; otherwise report what you saw. Never clear the error or send again. |
| `publication_changed` | Read only: the platform's observation found that GitHub or the record no longer matches the signed attempt (a different head, base or text, or a closed target). That is not proof nothing was sent, so never clear the error or receipt, retry, reopen or replace the PR. Compare the record with the live branch and PR; tell the owner what changed and which decision it needs (update the existing PR, prepare a replacement, or dismiss). Restage only after the owner decides. |

For every stack code, change only prepared, private layers: never modify,
rebase, restage or force-push a layer that is already public (draft, open) or
merged. If the repair would change a public layer, for example a public
layer sits above one that must be rebuilt, stop and ask the owner how to
proceed instead.

Then print a fresh card with `python3 /data/apps/contribute/prepared_block.py
<record-id> …` ([publish.md](publish.md) "Offering Send in chat"), so the
owner can press Send. A stack whose chain is not valid (layers from different
repositories, a layer in an unpublishable state, mismatched layer metadata) is
not an ask: its row says "Stack not valid" and the card opens Contribute. If the repair needs an owner decision (a changed
scope, a closed target PR, a different repository), ask for that decision
instead. A GitHub connection problem is never an ask: the card offers the
owner the account itself.
