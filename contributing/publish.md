# Contributing: publish after approval

Mode file of the `contributing` skill. The core
([SKILL.md](SKILL.md): Hard stops, privacy allowlist,
approval gate, file table) always applies. Nothing here runs without the
partner's scoped approval (Hard stop #1).

## The green light

Publish an `all_clear` record when the owner's instruction covers that work
under Hard stop #1. **Open PR** approves the displayed version; a clear chat
request to create the PR can also authorize preparing and publishing it.
Whichever surface carries the yes, re-read the canonical record immediately
before Send and use the same guarded submission path. A stale record returns
to **Review**, never publishes on stale evidence. Re-stage and re-review it,
then apply Hard stop #1 to decide whether the existing instruction still
covers publication. Do not stretch a version-pinned approval or automatically
ask again merely because review produced a new commit. No agent turn is needed
after a valid button press.

The platform's Send endpoint:

1. claims the `prepared` record as `submitting`,
2. verifies `plan.head_sha` still equals the branch tip, `diff_sha256` still
   equals the stored `.diff`, and the canonical `base_sha..head_sha` branch diff
   hashes to the same value,
3. verifies the commit carries the Möbius Agent co-author trailer, unless the
   reviewed plan set `coauthor_trailer: false`,
4. pushes to the target repository itself when the connected owner owns it or
   has push permission there (the commit must already carry the owner's
   identity); otherwise normalizes the tip commit author/committer to the
   connected owner while preserving the reviewed diff, adapts the reviewed
   topic commit to a strictly-behind reusable fork without changing its default
   branch, proves the upstream merge result still matches the exact reviewed
   diff (a diverged fork stops untouched), and pushes to the owner's fork,
5. creates a review-ready PR with the approved `title` and `body_draft`,
6. best-effort applies the reviewed `labels` that exist in the target repo, and
7. records `url`, `number`, label outcome, and `status: "open"` in the ledger.

If any preflight fails, the endpoint rolls the record back to `prepared` with
`last_submit_error`. Diagnose, repair within scope, and re-stage/re-review;
continue under the existing instruction when Hard stop #1 permits it. Stop
only for a genuinely missing decision or approval, not every failed preflight.

A record flipped to `abandoned` means the partner dropped it — never argue with
one, never resurrect it unasked.

## Offering Send in chat

When prepared, all-clear work is ready for the owner to send, show it in the
source chat instead of asking them to open Contribute:

```bash
python3 /data/apps/contribute/prepared_block.py <record-id> [<record-id> …]
```

Paste the printed `mobius-app` fence unchanged, in the chat whose work it is.
The card is that chat's live view of its contributions, read from the ledger:

- **What it shows.** One row per contribution: its PR title over its project
  and lines changed, with a pill once something happens. The helper names
  the records you list, every other contribution of this chat that is ready
  with its whole stack (`--chat-id`, default `$CHAT_ID`, required; unreviewed
  work is never pulled in), and every prepared layer of any stack among them.
  It refuses the card if any of those, stack layers included, is not all
  clear for its current head or is from another chat (review it, or restage
  it from this chat first). At most 12 contributions fit; with more, ask the
  owner to send some from Contribute first.
  A record re-prepared later shows its current version, a dismissed one says
  so, and one that belongs to another chat is never shown or sent.
- **One action.** **Send** (**Send N** for several) checks the current
  source and review of the records waiting to be sent and turns into **Not
  now** / **Confirm**, listing exactly those with the same values as the
  card's rows: project, any screenshots the PR will publish, the stack layer,
  and lines added (green) and removed (red). All of them or
  none: a row that cannot be sent is marked with a short pill (Needs review,
  Not sent, Conflicts, …) and the action becomes **Fix in chat**, which sends
  you a `contribute · <id> · <code>` request in this chat ([SKILL.md](SKILL.md)
  "Card asks"); on a Möbius without it, the action opens Contribute. A GitHub
  connection problem offers the owner the account instead. Fix that row's
  record and print a new card. Nothing is sent before Confirm,
  and the server refuses if a record changed after that snapshot.
  Independent contributions are sent in parallel; a stack's layers in order.
- **The newest card wins.** Only the last card printed in a chat is live; an
  earlier one folds to "Continued below". Print a new card whenever this
  chat prepares more work, instead of pointing the owner at an older one.
- **It stays current by itself.** It re-reads its records when it appears,
  when a turn in this chat settles and when the tab is shown again, so after
  you restage, review or the owner sends from Contribute, the card already
  shows it. A lost response keeps the card locked as **Checking GitHub**: it
  asks the platform to read GitHub for the exact attempt (read-only `/observe`)
  and never resends. **Changed on GitHub** means the target no longer matches
  the reviewed attempt; **With Autopilot** means the record's Autopilot owns
  the recovery.
  Neither is proof that nothing was sent. Once sent, each row links
  its pull request and the header says what happened.

The card is not approval: do not describe a printed card as sent or approved,
and do not send the same work again yourself while the card owns it. Cards
printed before this design only show their records' status (this chat's
records only); print a new card to send what they list. On a Möbius too old to
say which chat a card is in, the card works as before: it sends exactly the
records it lists, after the same Confirm.

## Updating an existing PR after approval

A prepared `pr_update` record (built as in *Updating an existing open PR* in
[branch.md](branch.md), restaged, and `all_clear`) is published with the same
guarded call the **Update PR** button uses. When the owner's chat instruction
already covers the update, call it directly:

```bash
mapi -X POST /api/github/contributions/<id>/<record-id>/update-existing \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

It rechecks the reviewed head and diff and the live PR identity before the
fast-forward push, and returns the record at `open` with `last_updated_pr_at`.
Then confirm the PR's `headRefOid` equals `plan.head_sha`. The `/update`
route is the autopilot's own path and needs a live autopilot run; do not use
it for owner-approved updates.

## After it's sent: autopilot

When the partner sends a PR with autopilot on (the default), the platform records
a **grant** authorizing a background loop to answer reviews on that PR until it
merges or closes. You don't drive that here — the platform starts a fresh
"Autopilot: …" chat per PR and runs the `review-followup` skill there. If a
review comes in and you're asked to respond in such a chat, follow that skill,
not this one.

The record may carry an `autopilot` block (`enabled`, `state`, `rounds`, …). It
is a **display-only mirror** the platform writes; the real grant + claim live in
a platform DB row you can't see or write. Never treat the ledger block as
authorization, and never hand-edit it to start, stop, or fake a round — it does
nothing. Pause/Resume needs an explicit partner action, either through the
Contribute control or an unambiguous chat instruction to use that same guarded
operation.

Existing PR stacks, merging, and app publication with a post-merge connection are in
[maintainer.md](maintainer.md); legacy `mobius-bot` sends
are in [legacy-bot.md](legacy-bot.md).

## Commenting on an issue or discussion

Publish the approved `body_draft` word for word — it posts under the partner's name.

```bash
gh issue comment <issue-url> --body "<the approved text>"
```

Discussions use GraphQL (`gh` has no discussion-comment subcommand):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id: ID!, $body: String!) {
  addDiscussionComment(input: {discussionId: $id, body: $body}) { comment { url } } }' \
  -F id=<discussion-node-id> -F body="<the approved text>"
```

## Editing a PR's title or description

Publish the approved text through GitHub's direct pull-request update. Do not
use `gh pr edit`: it also reads organization and project metadata and needs
`read:org`, which the scopes Contribute requests do not include.

```bash
gh api --method PATCH repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number> \
  -f title="<the approved title>" -F body=@<file-with-the-approved-body>
```

Send only the fields that changed. Reading the PR back with `gh pr view` is
fine: only the edit command needs the extra permission.

## When something fails

| Symptom | What it means / what to do |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **403 "OAuth App access restrictions"** | The organization has not approved the Möbius GitHub app. Ask an organization owner to approve it, then reconnect through Contribute. |
| **`gh: command not found`** | Platform image too old; a platform update is needed. |
| **`git push fork` fails right after the fork** | Forks are created async — wait 2s and retry, up to 3×, before treating it as real. |
| **Push says `workflow` scope is required, but the reviewed diff does not change a workflow** | The reusable fork is stale and lacks an identical workflow file. Update Contribute and reconnect GitHub so the full PR scope set is granted, then retry the unchanged review. |
| **`gh pr edit` asks for `read:org`** | Expected with Contribute's scopes; nothing changed. Use the direct update in "Editing a PR's title or description" above rather than requesting a broader scope. |
| **Send says the co-author trailer is missing** | Re-commit with the trailer and re-review. If the target's policy forbids it or the owner asked to omit it, set `plan.coauthor_trailer: false` as described in [prepare.md](prepare.md) and re-review. |
| **A PR's CI checks failed** | Diagnose with `/data/platform/scripts/ci-failures.sh <owner/repo> <pr-number>` as described in [ci.md](ci.md), then repair privately and re-stage. |
