# Respond to feedback: the saved result, and Post

The contract between `respond_result.py` (run by agents) and the Contribute app.
Lines that say "you" are for the agent doing a Respond job.

## What this is

A Respond-to-feedback job answers the points reviewers raised on one PR. It never
posts anything itself. When the work is done it **saves a result**. Contribute shows
that result in the PR's Review tab (each point and how it ended, the exact replies,
the commits and changed files, the tests) and the owner presses **Post**, **Reply in
chat** or **Discard**. Post sends the same chat one message that tells it to run
`respond_result.py post`; that command checks the owner's approval and posts exactly
what was shown, in a fixed order: upload the screenshots, push the commits, post the replies,
update the description, ask for the re-review. **Post works only where Möbius confirms the owner's
press on its own sheet (the gate, below)**; elsewhere it is off: the card still shows everything, and
nothing is posted.

## Where things live

Storage of the Contribute app, `/data/apps/<id>/` (`<id>` is the numeric id of the app
whose slug is `contribute`; the helper finds it in the database, like
`agent_snapshot.py`). `<slug>` is `<owner>__<repo>__<number>`, lower case
(`mobius-os__app-contribute__123`); `owner` and `repo` match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_.-]*`.

| File | Written by | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `respond-results/<slug>.json` | the helper only | the result (below) |
| `respond-results/<result id>.bundle` | the helper only | the commits as a Git bundle (absent when there are no commits) |
| `respond-screenshots/<result id>/<name>` | the helper only | the PNG bytes of each screenshot (absent when there are none) |
| `respond-decisions/<slug>.json` | the app only | the owner's decision about one result |

One result per PR: saving again replaces it. Two writers never share a file, so nothing
needs compare-and-swap. Every write is atomic (temporary file, then rename).

## The gate: Post needs Möbius to confirm the owner's press

The decision file is an ordinary file in the app's storage, and the responding agent can write that
storage itself, so a decision that names the right result and digest does not show that the owner
pressed Post. Möbius confirms the press itself, on a sheet outside the app's frame that neither the
app nor an agent can press, and records it as a one-time grant (platform: `window.mobius.ownerGrant`
and `/api/owner-grants`).

* **The capability.** The host advertises `owner_confirm` in the `capabilities` of
  `GET /api/github/contributions/<app id>/review-presets`, the place the app already reads
  `merge_now` and the other host features. `true` means: Möbius draws its own confirm sheet for the
  owner's sensitive taps. (The older `owner_grant` key is retired and no Möbius advertises it.) Without
  it, or on a page without `window.mobius.ownerGrant.request`, Post is off.
* **The app asks first.** `ownerConfirmOffered()` in `owner-grant.js` decides whether the card's Post,
  Send again and Try again are on (`ownerGrant` on `ResponseCard`, from `reviewProps` in
  `ui/PullRequests.jsx`). `approveResponse()` in `respond-flow.js`, after its own checks and before it
  writes the decision or tells the chat, asks Möbius to confirm action `respond_post` for
  `{repo, number, result_id, digest, chat_id}`: identifiers only, Möbius builds the words. A cancel
  writes and sends nothing; a refusal shows the platform's sentence, and so does a request that times
  out (the platform's ack and timeout make a tab whose shell code is older than the sheet fail fast this
  way until it reloads).
* **The helper spends it.** `post` spends the grant with `POST /api/owner-grants/consume`
  (`{app_id, action: "respond_post", body: {repo, number, result_id, digest}}`), through the
  platform's own `api` of `SCRIPTS_DIR/github_review.py` with the run's token; the chat is the one
  that token belongs to. It does so before it takes the lock, reads GitHub or writes anything, after
  reading only the saved result for the digest. The grant is single-use and lasts 15 minutes. A
  refusal (403) or any failure to ask (no core, no network, a Möbius without the route) stops `post`
  with exit 3 and one sentence. A result that is already posted, or an id that is not the saved one,
  is answered without spending it. A run that stopped after spending it needs the owner's next press
  (Send again or Try again), which asks Möbius again.
* **Off means.** `post` exits 3 and publishes nothing (no receipts, no state change, not even a lock
  file); `post --dry-run`, `save` and `show` work as before and spend nothing. In the app the Post
  button is disabled with the reason on the card ("Post is off for now: Möbius cannot yet confirm it
  was you who pressed it. The answer stays saved. Copy the replies to post them yourself, or use Reply
  in chat."); Reply in chat and Discard (which publishes nothing) stay on; the answer, replies and
  description stay readable.
* **On means only that the first check passes.** The approval, the digest and the PR checks below stay
  exactly as they are and are the second check. The grant shows that the owner tapped Post in Möbius for
  this PR, result and digest, naming this chat, once, and that a run in that chat spent it. It does not
  show that the helper posts what the digest names (the checks below do), and an agent that ignores the
  helper can still call `gh` by hand, as it could without Contribute.

## The result (`version: 1`)

```json

  "digest": "<64 hex>",

}
```

`screenshots` is absent when the answer adds none (a result saved before screenshots existed has no such key, and
keeps its digest). `receipts.screenshots` appears only for a result that has screenshots.

* `state`: `ready` (saved, nothing public done) → `posting` (the `post` command is running)
  → `posted`, or `failed` (it stopped part-way; see `error` and `receipts`).
* `pr.*` is read from GitHub at save time. `pr.head_sha` is the PR head the work was built
  on; `tip_sha` is the last commit of the work (`tip_sha == pr.head_sha` when there are no
  commits). `commits` are `pr.head_sha..tip_sha`, oldest first.
* `points[].ending` is exactly one of `fixed`, `not_valid`, `out_of_scope`. `commit`
  (full SHA, or `null`) must be one of `commits`.
* `replies[].reply_to` is a review-comment id (integer) to answer in that thread, or `null`
  for a plain PR comment. `description` is the complete new PR description or `null`.
  `rerequest` lists logins to ask for a new review (`[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,39}`).
* `files[].status` is `added`, `modified`, `removed` or `renamed` (a renamed file also has
  `previous_path`). `patch` holds the hunks only (from the first `@@`, the format of
  GitHub's REST `patch`), or `null` for a binary file or one over the caps, in which case
  `patch_omitted` is `true` (binary files also have `binary: true`).
* A point answering the owner's saved agent-review findings has the reviewer `Agent review`, exactly.
* `screenshots` (at most 8) are PNG files that the description shows as `![alt](screenshot:NAME)`. `name` is lower
  case letters, digits and hyphens ending in `.png`; each file is at most 2 MB and is stored under its name in
  `respond-screenshots/<result id>/`; `alt` is one line of at most 200 characters. Every screenshot must be
  referenced by the description and every reference must name a screenshot (a reference inside code does not
  count), so `post` can fill every link and no attachment is forgotten. A reference does not prove the description
  shows the image (inside a comment, or as a plain link, it shows nothing), so the card also lists every attached
  screenshot on its own, and Post stays off until each one is on screen: the owner approves exactly the bytes
  that are uploaded, however the description names them. These are the rules of the platform's screenshots for a
  new PR (`contribution_screenshots.py`).
* Caps: 30 points; point title 160, answer 400, reviewer 60 characters; 12 replies of at
  most 20 000 characters; description at most 60 000; 10 logins; tests 500; 60 commits;
  300 files; a file's path 4 096 (Linux's `PATH_MAX`, so every path Git reports fits); a file's
  patch 60 000 and all patches together 400 000 characters. A commit title longer than 300
  characters is cut to 300 (ending in `…`) when saved; the SHA is what names the commit. Every
  count is in characters (Unicode code points), on both sides: an emoji is one character, in
  Python and in the app's JavaScript. Text must be valid Unicode (no lone surrogates).
* `digest` is the SHA-256 (lower-case hex) of the UTF-8 bytes of this object written with
  `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False)`:
  `{"v": 1, "pr_head": pr.head_sha, "tip": tip_sha, "points": [{reviewer, title, ending, commit, answer}…],
  "replies": [{body, reply_to}…], "description": …, "rerequest": […], "commits": [sha…]}`, plus
  `"screenshots": [{name, sha256}…]` when there are any. It binds what the owner read to what gets posted.
* `receipts`: `screenshots` is `{"commit", "at"}` once uploaded (a claim outside the digest: `post` reuses it only after
  the commit's public addresses serve the approved bytes, see below); `push` is `{"sha", "at"}` once done; `replies` is a list of
  `{"index", "url", "at"}`; `description` is `{"at"}`; `rerequest` is `{"at", "reviewers"}`.
  `sending` is `{"index", "at"}` while a reply may be on its way or is unknown (below), else `null`.
  `error` is `{"step", "message"}` when `state` is `failed`.

## The decision (`respond-decisions/<slug>.json`, written by the app)

```json
{ "version": 1, "result_id": "r-3f9a1c2b04d5", "digest": "<64 hex>", "decision": "approved", "at": "2026-11-06T09:30:00Z" }
```

`decision` is `approved` (Post pressed) or `discarded` (Discard pressed). A decision counts only
for the `result_id` and `digest` it names; any other result ignores it. Asking for another pass
needs no decision: the new result replaces the old one when it is saved.

## The helper: `python3 /data/apps/contribute/respond_result.py`

Standard library only; `gh` and `git` are used the way the other helpers use them.

### `save --pr owner/repo#N --repo-path DIR --input FILE [--chat-id ID]`

You run this when the work is finished, from your private copy (`--repo-path`), then stop.
`--chat-id` defaults to `$CHAT_ID`. `FILE` is the part only you can write:

```json
{
  "points": [ { "reviewer": "…", "title": "…", "ending": "fixed", "commit": "8bc1054", "answer": "…" } ],
  "replies": [ { "body": "…", "reply_to": null } ],
  "description": null,
  "rerequest": ["…"],
  "tests": "…",
  "screenshots": [ { "name": "before-desktop.png", "path": "/absolute/path/to/file.png", "alt": "one line saying what it shows" } ]
}
```

`screenshots` is optional. `commit` may be a prefix of at least 7 hex characters of one of your commits. Git supplies
everything else (commits, files, patches, the bundle), the PR's head comes from GitHub.

It refuses (exit 2, nothing written) when: the input breaks a rule above; the PR is not open
or does not match `--pr`; `--repo-path` has uncommitted changes; the PR head is not an
ancestor of `HEAD` (your commits must sit on top of it, never rebased); a point names a
commit that is not in the range; there is nothing to show (no commits and no replies).
It refuses with exit 3 when this PR's saved result is `posting`. Otherwise it replaces any
earlier result for the PR (removing its bundle and its decision file).

### `show --pr owner/repo#N`

Prints the saved result without patches, and whether the owner has approved it.

### `post --pr owner/repo#N --id RESULT_ID [--dry-run]`

The only command that does public things. Contribute tells the chat to run it after the
owner presses Post. Unless `--dry-run` is given it first spends the owner's confirmation (the
gate, above) and, when that is refused, exits 3 before touching anything. Then, in this order, it:

1. loads the result (its `id` must match; `posted` means nothing to do, exit 0);
2. requires the decision file to say `approved` for this `result_id` and the stored `digest`;
3. recomputes the digest from the result's content and requires it to equal the stored one;
4. reads the PR from GitHub: open, still aimed at `pr.base_ref`, and its head is `pr.head_sha` (or `tip_sha` when the
   push already happened, see below);
5. with `--dry-run`, prints the plan and stops here;
6. sets `state` to `posting`, then does each step that has no receipt yet:
   * **screenshots** (only when the result has some): before any step, each stored file must still have its
     approved SHA-256 (otherwise Post refuses). A receipt from an earlier run is only a claim, so its commit is
     reused only when it is a full commit id whose anonymous `raw.githubusercontent.com` addresses serve images
     that each hash to the approved SHA-256; otherwise the receipt is ignored and the images are uploaded again.
     Uploading adds them in one commit on top of the `mobius-screenshots` branch of `pr.head_repo`
     (`screenshots/<head_ref>/<result id>/<name>`, fast-forward only, created when it does not exist;
     a branch that holds anything but `screenshots/` is refused), then proves anonymous
     `raw.githubusercontent.com` addresses of that commit serve exactly those bytes. A repository GitHub does
     not serve publicly stops Post here, before anything else is public. The commit is the receipt, and the only
     commit the description links is the one proven in this run;
   * **push**: `tip_sha` to `refs/heads/<pr.head_ref>` of `pr.head_repo`, fast-forward only
     (never forced), from the bundle (fetch the PR head, fetch the bundle, push); then check
     GitHub shows `tip_sha` as that branch's head. GitHub moves the PR's own head some seconds
     after the branch, so the step then waits (up to 30 seconds) while the PR still shows
     `pr.head_sha`; a PR that still lags after that stops the post with the push receipted, and
     a second run carries on. Skipped when there are no commits;
   * **replies**: one `POST` each (`issues/<n>/comments`, or
     `pulls/<n>/comments/<reply_to>/replies` when `reply_to` is set), in order. Before each
     write `receipts.sending` is saved; it is cleared once the receipt is, or when GitHub answers
     the write with a 4xx (refused, so not applied). Any other end of the write (a timeout, a dropped
     connection, a 5xx, a crash) leaves the reply **unknown**, and `post` never sends an unknown
     reply again. A run that finds `sending` set only looks on GitHub, through the owner's recent
     comments (`GET user`, then `issues/<n>/comments` or `pulls/<n>/comments` with `since` a minute
     before `sending.at`), for one with exactly that body (and in that thread): found, it is
     receipted with its link, `sending` is cleared and the post carries on; not found, the step
     stops (exit 4) and the reply stays unknown, because a request that timed out can still finish
     on GitHub after any one lookup. If GitHub cannot be asked, the step stops too. Only the owner
     settles a reply that never shows up: posting that exact reply by hand, which the next look finds;
   * **description**: `PATCH pulls/<n>` with the new body, when `description` is not `null`; each
     `(screenshot:NAME)` is replaced by its commit-pinned address, so the approved text keeps its references;
   * **re-request**: `POST pulls/<n>/requested_reviewers`, when `rerequest` is not empty;
   each success is written to `receipts` at once, so a second run continues where the first
   stopped and never repeats a step. The PR is read again (open, same head branch, same base,
   head still `pr.head_sha` or the tip) right before every step after the first and before every
   reply, so a PR that moved, was retargeted or was closed part-way stops what is left; what
   already went out stays in the receipts;
7. sets `state` to `posted`.

Refusals before step 6 change nothing and exit 3 with the reason (the owner's confirmation is
missing or already used, not approved, digest or id mismatch, PR closed, PR moved or retargeted). A failure inside step 6 sets `state` to `failed` with
`error`, keeps the receipts and exits 4. Every GitHub write goes through `gh api` with the
JSON body on standard input. Test hooks: `RESPOND_APP_DIR` replaces the storage directory;
`RESPOND_GIT_REMOTE` replaces the Git URL used to fetch and push; the gate reaches the host through
`SCRIPTS_DIR` (its `github_review.py`), which the tests point at `test/fixtures/fake_host`, a fake
host whose answer to the consume call comes from `FAKE_HOST_CONSUME`.

Exit codes: 0 done, 2 bad input, 3 refused, 4 failed part-way.

## What the app does with it

* **Reads** both folders with the sync hub (every 2.5 s while an answer is being posted, for five
  minutes after Post; every 30 s otherwise) and pairs each result with its decision.
* **Status** of a result on its PR: `ready` (fresh: the PR head still equals `pr.head_sha`),
  `stale` (the head moved), `approved` (approved, not yet `posting`), `posting`, `posted`,
  `failed`, or none (discarded). For the first 30 s after the decision's `at`, `approved` is "the
  chat is starting": the card says **Sent to the chat** with a spinner and offers no Send again
  (both real posts had the message at the chat in 2 s and the first step done by 8.6 s). After
  that it says **Not started yet** and offers Send again; if the message to the chat failed it
  offers Send again at once.
* **PR logic** (unchanged): `ready` and `approved` supply the existing "draft" fact, `posting` the
  "sending" fact, `failed` the "unconfirmed" fact. `stale` and none supply nothing, so the PR
  reads "Feedback to answer" again.
* **Review tab card**: points with their ending, the replies word for word, the description (with its
  screenshots shown, each read from `respond-screenshots/` and only shown when its SHA-256 is the one in the
  result), a list of every attached screenshot on its own with a line saying they are uploaded to the PR's
  repository (Post is off until each one has been read and matched), commits and changed files, the tests, what Post will do in order, and Post, Reply in chat and
  Discard. Post is off where Möbius does not confirm it (the gate), while the PR moved, while the
  chat is working, and while the chat waits on one of its own cards (a chat with an open card
  refuses new messages); the card says why in words.
* **Screenshots are required for any front-end change.** The brief says so (a screen, component, style or theme
  file; before and after, desktop and 390 px; the same exception as for a new PR: a picture that cannot show the
  change is explained in the description). The card flags an answer whose changed files include front-end files
  (`.jsx .tsx .vue .svelte .css .scss .html` or a `*theme*.js`, never under `test/`) and that lists no screenshots,
  in the same place the owner decides. It warns; it does not block, because whether a change is visible is the
  owner's call.
* **Post** re-reads the result, checks its digest is the one on screen and the PR head is still
  `pr.head_sha`, has Möbius confirm it on its own sheet (the gate), writes the decision (`approved`),
  then sends the chat (`chat_id`) this message
  with the stable id `respond-post-<result id>`; if the platform definitely refuses it, the
  decision is removed again:

  ```
  Approved in Contribute: post result <id> for <repo>#<number>, built on <head sha, 7 characters>.

  Run exactly this and report what it printed:

      python3 /data/apps/contribute/respond_result.py post --pr <repo>#<number> --id <id>

  It posts only what was shown and approved, and checks the approval and the PR head itself.
  Do not push, comment, reply or edit anything on GitHub by hand. If it refuses, say why and stop.
  ```
* **Discard** writes the decision `discarded`. **Respond again** sends the new brief into the same
  chat (the platform returns an existing chat for the PR's scope without sending a new job, so the
  app delivers it as a message, like project work); the old result stays until the new one replaces it.
  The window names that chat's agent, read from the app's own chat list for the scope. The started
  chat holds the PR in the app at once (the platform lists it only once its turn is live), until a
  read of the runs names it or for one minute at most, and the runs are read again right away.
* The brief given to the Respond agent ends with the `save` command, not with an approval card,
  and tells it that it never pushes, posts, replies, resolves or changes anything on GitHub.
