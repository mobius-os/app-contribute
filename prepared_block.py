"""Print the chat card for prepared contributions. No writes.

The card is the chat's live view of its contributions. On a Möbius that runs
it (`rows-v2`), the card shows what the ledger says now: the records it names,
followed to their current version and kept only when they belong to the chat
the card is shown in, each as its title over its project and lines changed,
with its state once something happens. Its one action, Send (Send N for
several), becomes Not now / Confirm over exactly the records that are ready at
that tap; nothing is sent before that Confirm. Only the newest card of a chat is
live: an earlier one folds to "Continued below". Every card has the same
block intent, so the chat host can tell which card is the newest.

The items printed here are a static fallback for a host that cannot run the
card. They name where to look; they never decide what is sent.
The card has no inline app view (`"expand": false`).
