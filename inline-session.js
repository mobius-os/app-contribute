// The in-chat Send session behind a Contribute card. Pure state: the host
// renders the controls, this model says what each one may do. Reading never
// sends; only the owner's Confirm of a frozen snapshot reaches the app's
// guarded Send handlers, which bind that snapshot on the server.
//
// What a card shows comes from the ledger, not from the card. The chat host
// attests which chat the card is in and whether it is that chat's newest card
// (`context`, `rows-v2`). The card's rows are the records its items name,
// followed through `superseded_by` to their current version, kept only when
// they belong to that chat; its action covers those still waiting to be sent.
// Only the newest card of a chat is live: an earlier one folds to "Continued
// below". A card the host cannot attest, and every card printed before this
// one, only shows status and never sends.
//
// The card re-reads its records (exact local reads, no network) when it
// mounts, when a turn in its chat settles and when the tab is shown again.
// GitHub and the source are checked only when the owner taps the action, and
// a check younger than REVIEW_REUSE_MS is reused.
//
// Each Confirm creates immutable attempts, one per independent unit. Units run
// in parallel; a stack's layers are sent in order by its one stack request.
// Only attempts whose outcome is unknown cross a reload, and they lock their
// unit until a read-only observation proves the result. While one is unknown
// the card asks the platform to read GitHub for it (`observe`, shared with the
// app's refresh in publication-observer.js) and re-reads its records, with
// backoff, for RECHECK_WINDOW_MS after the send; it never sends again. A
// settled answer shows the pull request; a published branch whose PR is not
// confirmed keeps "Checking GitHub"; a target that changed holds the row
// (`publication_changed`); a record with Autopilot on that the platform does
// not observe is left to Autopilot. Every answer and finding belongs to one
// exact record version: a late answer for an older version is dropped, and a
// new version is observed afresh. Without the observe route (an older
// Möbius) the card only re-reads.
//
// The card reports calm state to the host: a live title, and per row a status
// pill, the pull request link once published, and one short reason when a
// send failed (building-apps.md "Passive block sessions").
//
// When a held or failed row needs something only this chat's agent can do,
// a host that draws asks (`ask-v1`) gets "Fix in chat" in place of the
// action: the held record's id and a stable code (card-asks.js), which the
// host sends in its own words as the owner's message. A GitHub connection problem opens the
// account instead. Without `ask-v1` the action opens Contribute, as before.
