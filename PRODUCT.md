# Contribute product context

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

Web app inside the Möbius workspace, responsive from phone to wide desktop.

## Users

The owner of a local Möbius instance today, and people collaborating on their own projects through the same workflow in future.

## Product Purpose

Move changes from local work into private review, public collaboration, and safe local reconciliation without making people restate the process every time.

## Positioning

A Continuous Project Desk, not a Git client. See what remains local, what is
shared for review, and whether shared updates have been checked. Choose one project, then prepare or review its work; approve exact public actions when ready.

## Operating Context

Changes still begin in their source chats, and a chat's Changes view only lists
its edits. To prepare them, ask the conversation that owns them, or prepare the
whole project in Contribute, the cross-chat project overview. Current code
establishes what needs preparation; chat diffs are provenance, not a second
source tree.

The landing view is a searchable project index, without global mutation controls. Each project shows
local/private/public work and its last-known shared-version relationship.
Selecting a project keeps those facts and scoped controls visible, with its
questions, ready batch, incoming requests, progress and history underneath.
A contribution opens within that project; Back and Forward preserve the same
project and contribution. No separate Reviews room or second ledger exists.

Main controls must not disappear into catch-all overflow menus. Simplicity
means fewer steps and clearer information, not smaller type or hidden project
position. Agent work progresses in place; only actual questions need the owner.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Public GitHub actions always retain an exact owner approval checkpoint.
- One approval may cover a mixed set of standalone and stacked pull requests,
  but it must enumerate every exact public action and preserve stack order.
- An all-clear review belongs to the exact reviewed version and becomes stale when that version changes.
- Existing local and private work must be preserved during reconciliation.
- Project status can establish source relationships, but it cannot always infer whether local differences are reusable, personal, or already covered. The UI must distinguish clear preparation candidates from work that needs sorting.
- The same workflow should extend beyond Möbius-owned projects as project adapters grow.
- Chat keeps only decisions and attention above the composer; healthy public and settled work belongs in Contribute.
- Deterministic status refresh, accepted-work recognition, duplicate detection, and lost-response reconciliation run automatically; they never summon an agent merely to repeat the ledger.
- One changed-work conversation owns the remaining private judgment. Repeated actions reuse it until the represented source or contribution head changes.
- The normal personal-GitHub publication opens reviewed pull requests ready for
  review. Draft is an intentional exception, not a mandatory extra stage: the
  owner who works draft-first sets it once in Settings (New pull requests start
  as) or picks it for a single send from the arrow on the button.
- Publication never implies merge. Queueing or merging is a later, separate,
  exact approval against the current public head.
- Source chats remain the durable home of their work. Background workers may
  contribute evidence or independent edits, but they never become the owner-facing source.

### Selected-PR run contract

Keep the local and GitHub overview and the prepare loop; extend that project
workspace rather than introducing a replacement Reviews room. Updates belong
to Möbius Settings (platform) and the App Store (apps); Contribute reports
them and links there instead of running a second updater. PR body, checks,
labels, reviewers/comments and source conversation are deliberate detail.

Review-only, legacy pinned conditional merge and explicit named-PR
review/fix/merge are distinct scopes. Takeover is bounded to server-frozen PR
files and independently reviewed successor heads, never arbitrary changed
versions, comments or force-push. Editable prompts, private
autopilot and model/effort resolve into a frozen pre-consent snapshot; execution
rejects drift and cannot rewrite mandatory safety instructions. Old grants do
not inherit autopilot or broader scope.

New review/fix/merge runs have no repair-round budget. Previously frozen finite
selections retain their limit rather than silently expanding an accepted run.
Stop, clarification, exact scope, independent review and required checks still
control continuation.

One owning chat, durable programmatic independent reviewers, dedicated repair
checkout and public receipts carry the actual review—not a preview proposal or
an all-clear inferred from green checks. Paused work has a name and remaining
steps; queued is not merged. Read-only receipt observation never revives Stop.
Core Settings GitHub workflows work without this optional app, through the same
platform owner and grant mechanisms, not a second queue.

## Brand Commitments

Quiet, inviting, high-level, concise, and icon-led. Show the next meaningful action before technical detail.

## Evidence on Hand

Live local project status, private contribution records and stored diffs, and connected GitHub review state.

## Product Principles

1. Lead with the next action.
2. Never overstate certainty.
3. Lead with project position; group the same review run by decision within the selected scope.
4. Make detail and diffs immediate once an item is selected.
5. Keep one deliberate owner checkpoint for public actions.
6. Let the source chat start and complete its work, and Contribute project the
   project-scoped run without inventing a second workflow.
7. Automate facts; reserve agent work for intent, grouping, review, and repair.
8. Completed intent disappears; failures continue automatically unless a real
   owner or account decision is required.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Keyboard-accessible controls, state labels that do not depend on color, readable contrast, practical touch targets, and an adaptive list-to-detail flow on small screens.

## Minimal daily workflow (owner direction, 2026-10-02)

Use a linked project repository, real status refresh, a prepare launch panel, actionable prepared work above PRs, compact PR authors/labels/check counts and person assignment. Agent launch offers private review with optional review-only autopilot, or scoped review/fix/merge with automatic continuation; model and effort belong to that launch. Settings contains one grouped prompt editor, not a second automation or model console. Project work and History retain meaningful current/past work (a new full merge cycle is a Prepare option offered with merge rights); hiding archived proposals never deletes their records. Version/scope/prompt freezing stays mandatory underneath but does not require routine disclosures or duplicate decisions. Read-only guards remain intentional. New explicitly approved draft takeover reviews and fixes while draft, then marks ready only after fresh independent review and checks. Old grants retain their draft boundary.

## GitHub alignment and live versions (2026-10-03)

The PR list and detail follow GitHub's own presentation
(state icons, colored labels, "#123 · author opened …", ✓ n/m checks). A run is
bound to each PR's exact head and to the target branch's live tip at the moment
of consent; GitHub's PR comparison base is not used for that binding. At Start
the selected PRs are re-read: unchanged code follows a moved target branch,
while changed code or draft state requires the owner to look again. The
upstream position states incoming files (or commits behind), the same units as
local work. Default review, fix and merge prompts are short, readable guidance
that widens review scope and fixes causes; mechanics and authority stay in the
fixed run brief and mandatory instructions.

## Plain words (owner direction, 2026-10-26)

Every control says what it does for someone who has never used Contribute:
"Make PRs from my edits" rather than "Prepare changes", **Sync with GitHub** with
its last time written beside it rather than a silent refresh icon, "Mark ready for review" for
an own draft, and labelled **Assign** and **Actions ▾** buttons on PR rows. An
action shows feedback when used. Sync with GitHub asks GitHub read-only whether a
repository moved past the compared commit; a quiet project reads "Up to date at
the last check" until a fresh check says more. The agent review window states
its steps, what GitHub will see and which model runs it before anything starts.
A project opens on To look at (blockers before news, each with its reason, PR
and detection time), then its status, then All PRs, Review requests and My work; the projects list tags Platform and App projects, says what waits on
the owner, and folds apps with nothing to do.

## Act where you are looking (owner direction, 2026-11-04)

- **Actions ▾** (it was Agent ▾) holds what the owner can do and what an agent
  can do for a PR. A **You** group comes first: **Open for review** on a draft
  this app sent, and **Merge** where the platform can merge for the owner (the
  menu offers it only when the platform advertises it). The **Agent** group keeps
  the four agent jobs. The best next step is first and highlighted; a choice that
  cannot run stays in place, dimmed, with its reason. A batch selection offers
  only agent jobs.
- Each of the owner's own actions ends in a **confirm sheet**: it states what
  happens, what GitHub shows right now (approval, checks, conflicts, what the
  owner's own agent review said about this exact version) and what Contribute
  cannot undo. The X is its only way out, so there is no Cancel (the Review and
  Respond to feedback windows work the same way); a finished action swaps it for
  Done. Merge asks how it lands only when the repository
  allows more than one way, merges exactly the version shown, and is never
  repeated after an unconfirmed answer. **Only a decoded receipt for the action
  is a success and only a decoded refusal (a 4xx whose body can be read) is a plain
  failure.** A lost connection, a server error, an answer that cannot be read
  (whatever its status) or the wrong receipt may have reached GitHub, so the sheet reads that as unconfirmed: it has the view read
  GitHub again first, and its button stays off, so another attempt can only
  start from that fresh read. This holds for Merge, Open for review and Post to
  GitHub alike.
- **Open as draft / Open for review** is one split button on the prepared-PR
  card; the arrow offers the other stage for that send. The stage is part of the
  exact approval, the confirmation text and the chat Send card (which freezes it
  at Confirm), so what is confirmed is what opens.
- **Whose turn it is** is the PR machine's decision (see below), never the
  review's saved word alone (needs_you says what the review *found*). After
  Request changes the PR waits on its author and the row reads **Waiting on
  <author>**; when they push new commits after any review of yours it reads
  **New commits · review again**. A finding on the owner's own PR stays theirs
  until they fix it or set it aside.
- **The Review tab answers instead of asking for a conversation.** A finished
  review that found problems offers **Fix these findings** (Respond to feedback with
  the saved findings ticked), **Ignore…** (one reason, for this exact version,
  kept in Contribute, nothing posted, with Undo), **Review again** and **Ask the
  reviewer something** as a plain button. "Answer in review conversation" is
  only for a conversation that really asked something, and "Stop review" only
  while work is in progress.
- **A saved Respond to feedback answer comes first on the Review tab**: each point and
  how it ended, the replies word for word, the new description, the commits and changed
  files, the tests, and what Post will do in order, with **Post**, **Reply in chat** and
  **Discard**. Post saves the owner's approval for exactly that answer and tells the chat
  to run one checked command; nothing is pushed or posted before it. **Post is off until
  Möbius can confirm it was the owner who pressed it** (an approval the agent could have
  written itself proves nothing): the button is disabled with that reason on the card, and
  the answer, Reply in chat and Discard keep working. The PR reads **Draft
  to send** while the answer waits, **Sending** while it posts and **Not confirmed** if it
  stops part-way (a retry skips what already went out, and a reply that may have gone out
  is only looked for, never sent again). Right after Post the card says
  **Sent to the chat** with a spinner, and **Send again** appears only if the chat has not
  started after 30 seconds (at once if the message to the chat failed). When the PR moves after the
  answer, the card says it is out of date and offers **Respond again** or **Discard**, and
  while the chat waits on a card of its own, its box asks first and Post says why it is off.
  **Respond again** names the agent the PR's conversation keeps (model and effort; a second
  pass builds on the first, so there is no picker), and once it starts the Review tab shows
  **Working on feedback** at once, with the old answer's Post held back, instead of after
  the next read.
- **PR reviews** (side menu) lists the reviews the owner started, by project, in
  two tabs: **In progress** (waiting on the owner first, then agents at work, then
  anything stuck or unreadable) and **Done**. Every PR is read live, in batches of
  25, when the list changes and again on every Sync with GitHub, so a closed PR is
  history, a pushed PR comes back as new commits (after a clear or approved review
  too, though on the owner's own PR it is only an older version), a stale finding
  is never counted as waiting on the owner, and a PR GitHub did not return reads
  **Couldn’t read** with Try again instead of being classified from older saved
  data.

## The PR machine: one decision for every screen and the server (owner direction, 2026-11-04)

`pr-machine.js` decides, for one PR, where it stands for you and what may happen
next: `decide(facts)` returns the state, whose turn it is, the row label, the
headline under the title, the one highlighted action, and every action with
`enabled` and its plain reason. `pr-facts.js` builds the facts from GitHub's PR
read (including each person's review *with the version it was of*, and your own
latest review, so reviews made on GitHub itself count) plus Contribute's own runs.
`pr-standing.js` turns a decision into a row's frame and chip. Every screen (PR
rows, desk rows, the PR page, its Actions menu, the Review tab's buttons, PR
reviews) renders that decision; none works it out again. The platform runs the
same table (`contribution_pr_machine.py`) before every effect it performs, and both
are held to the same cases: `test/pr-machine.cases.json` is kept byte-identical in
both repositories.

**Two roles.** *Author*: you wrote the PR (or an agent of yours opened it). *Reviewer*:
someone else wrote it.

**Rules the machine enforces** (each is an invariant in `test/pr-machine.test.mjs`,
checked over every case and every combination of the facts that matter):

1. An author never gets a public review action. An agent's check of your PR is private.
2. A PR is *ready to merge* with an approval of this exact version by someone other than the author (a bot
   never counts), no change request still standing (even on an older version), checks
   that pass or do not exist, no conflicts, nothing unconfirmed on its way to GitHub
   (a new commit does not settle it: it holds until reconciled, while a draft goes
   stale with its version), no agent job running, and no review GitHub itself still
   requires (a branch rule: "GitHub still needs a review"). GitHub asking for no review
   is not an approval. Ready to merge
   words the PR's standing and its highlighted next step; it does not switch your own Merge off
   (owner direction, 2026-11-09: skip the formalities), and GitHub's merge rules still refuse what cannot
   land. The agent's own unattended merge has no tap behind it, so the platform still asks the full
   rule before it merges. The Merge sheet names who approved and who still holds a change request. An approval
   of an older commit still counts when the PR's own added and removed lines are the same:
   the fact readers compare each version with the base's current tip (`same-work.js` and
   `carried-approvals.js` in the app, `contribution_same_work.py` in the platform, held to
   `test/same-work.cases.json`) and mark the approval `sameWork`. A comparison that cannot say
   (cut off at 300 files, unreadable, a changed file with no lines) leaves it old; a file
   with no lines is compared by its content id. Known limit: hunk positions and context are
   ignored (they move whenever the base does), so a line moved elsewhere in its file still
   compares as the same, and so does a change only to a file's final newline. Only open PRs in repositories the
   viewer can write to are compared.
3. Only new commits bring their PR back for re-review; a reply or a thank-you never does.
   That includes a clean private review of their PR: at its own version it reads as done
   (nothing to send, nothing to set aside); once they push, the PR is back to re-review.
   Your own PR is never nagged about an older clean check.
   A reviewer who only commented has not approved. With a change request still standing, GitHub lifts it
   only on their approval or a dismissal, so the PR reads *Looked again · not approved*; with none, it
   reads *Commented · not approved*. Either way the next step is Ask for approval, one note on the PR
   naming only them, and it can be sent while their comment still waits for your answer.
   Both Ask actions open a checklist of everyone who reviewed or commented, except those who already
   approved this version, with the people each ask is meant for ticked (owner direction, 2026-11-09).
   The note says what is true of each person it names: commented on this version, a change request of
   an earlier version, an approval of an earlier version. It must fit the platform's 1,000 characters,
   and typed-in names are not offered. A review that
   only comments, with words in it, is feedback to answer like a comment in the PR's conversation: it
   reads *Feedback to answer* until you reply (a reply, or the Ask for approval note, answers it).
4. One agent job per PR at a time. A job that stalled holds nothing. A Respond to
   feedback conversation counts as the PR's job for as long as it can still move.
5. Take over is for maintainers only, and needs a reason.
6. Unknown stays unknown: missing checks are never green, and a PR that could not be
   read enables nothing that depends on it. That includes a list of reviews GitHub
   says goes on past the first page (30 writers): an opinion on the next page could
   be a change request, so the PR reads as not read.
7. Only four things stop an action of yours: the PR cannot be read, it is closed or merged,
   an agent is already working on it, or something sent to GitHub is not confirmed (and a
   draft that deals with the findings owns them until you send it or throw it away). Nothing
   else dims one: Respond to feedback, Review, Finish it, Merge, Close, Open for review and Back
   to draft stay on whatever the reviews say (Open for review on an open PR, or Back to draft on
   a draft, is a confirmed no-op). An action that needs a thing waits for it: Send, Check
   GitHub and Discard for a draft, Ask for re-review and Ask for approval for someone to ask,
   Set aside for a result, Answer the agent for a question.

**Who acts.** Pushing code, merging and changing a PR's status (ready, draft, closed)
always wait for your own tap. A review verdict waits for your tap ("Draft for me"),
unless you chose "Agent posts" for that review.

**Agent jobs.** Your PR: Check my PR (private) · Respond to feedback (every point ends
fixed with its commit, not valid with the reason and an @mention, or out of scope; it
never reviews again, and its result waits in the PR's Review tab until you press Post,
which pushes the fixes, posts every reply, updates the description and asks for the
re-review) · Finish it for me (stops before each push for your approval). Their PR:
Review, which reads Re-review once you reviewed it, with an optional "Merge after I
approve" switch · Take over, set apart, maintainers only, with a reason. Your own
actions: Open for review, Back to draft, Ask for re-review, Ask for approval, Merge and Close, each
behind a confirm sheet and each shown only where this Möbius can do it.

**States.** Shared: Merged · Closed · Couldn’t read · Not confirmed · Sending · Draft to
send · Agent working · Agent asks you · Agent stopped. Your PR: Draft · Ready to open ·
Findings · Checks or conflicts · Feedback to answer · Waiting on re-review · Looked again,
not approved · Commented, not approved · Approval is old · Waiting on reviewers · Approved (checks pending or unknown) · Ready to merge. Their
PR: Draft · To review · Review ready · Waiting on the author · New commits · review
again · Reviewed · Kept private · Ready to merge.
