// How a new pull request opens from Contribute: as a draft nobody is asked to
// review yet, or ready for review. A shipped default of 'ready' keeps the
// product's documented normal publication (PRODUCT.md); an owner who works
// draft-first sets 'draft' in Settings. Only a new PR on the owner's own GitHub
// account has a choice: an update edits an existing PR, and a relay draft is
// always a draft.
