Use the project’s own browser harness, or the live app when it already shows the change. If a picture truly cannot show the change (it appears only on a real device), say so in the description instead. Contribute’s app needs 10 to 15 seconds to read GitHub before it shows anything, so open it once, wait until the screen has loaded (a first capture shows “Opening Contribute…”), then capture again. Add each picture to result.json as {"name": "before-desktop.png", "path": "<absolute path of the PNG>", "alt": "one line saying what it shows"} under "screenshots", and show it in the description as ![alt](screenshot:before-desktop.png).
